**Transrecursive Theory: Rethinking the Limits of Computable Growth**

**Author:** Arthur Mataryan, October 14, 2025

Imagine a mathematical universe where numbers don't just grow—they evolve, changing not only their magnitude but the very rules of growth itself. This is the essence of Transrecursive Growth Theory (TRT)—an innovative system that redefines our understanding of number growth and computational boundaries. By introducing a new class of functions, TRT offers a continuous, self-amplifying hierarchy that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in computable mathematics.

### What is TRT?

At the heart of TRT lies the idea of measuring and utilizing the *complexity* of numbers, not just their magnitude. Traditional googology—the science of enormous numbers—relies on discrete methods like exponentiation, tetration, or combinatorial structures (such as Graham's number, TREE(3)). These methods create gigantic numbers but operate within fixed frameworks. TRT, however, introduces a dynamic, self-referential system where numbers are mapped onto a continuous scale of computational complexity, allowing growth to accelerate in unimaginable ways.

The key element of TRT is the **Hierarchical Computable Complexity Scale Function (HCCSF)**, which assigns each number a "position" on a continuous complexity scale. Unlike logarithmic scales that compress large numbers for convenient display, HCCSF captures a number's *ontological level*—its place in the hierarchy of computational power. Building on this foundation, TRT constructs a sequence of functions: **TRANSCEND, META_TRANSCEND, ULTIMATE_TRANSCEND, GOD_TRANSCEND, ABSOLUTE**, and **UNIVERSUM**, each amplifying growth by building upon the complexity of the previous level.

### A New Type of Growth

Traditional fast-growing functions, such as the Ackermann function or the Fast-Growing Hierarchy (FGH), use discrete steps indexed by ordinals (e.g., ω, ε₀). They create enormous numbers, but their growth is constrained by fixed structures. TRT, in contrast, introduces a *meta-recursive* approach where a number's growth determines a new complexity scale, which in turn generates even more powerful growth.

For example:

- **HCCSF** maps a number (such as a googolplex or TREE(3)) to its "complexity level"—ranging from polynomial (level 0) to hyper-exponential (levels 2–3) and beyond.
- **TRANSCEND** takes this complexity value, transforms it into a new level via the inverse function HCCSF⁻¹, and uses it to create a number that surpasses any fixed FGH level.
- **META_TRANSCEND** iteratively applies TRANSCEND across all complexity scales, creating a growth cascade.
- **ULTIMATE_TRANSCEND** and **GOD_TRANSCEND** add nested loops and super-reflection, amplifying growth to transfinite scales.
- **ABSOLUTE** introduces fractal branching, where the number of child nodes depends on the parent's value, creating an almost two-dimensional complexity space.
- **UNIVERSUM** combines all possible combinations of these functions, maximizing growth within computability.

Each function in this chain doesn't merely increase a number—it changes the very nature of growth, transitioning from arithmetic to the ontology of complexity.

### Comparison with Other Hierarchies

TRT stands out among other googological systems:

- **Ackermann function and FGH**: Indexed by ordinals (ω, ε₀) but remain discrete. TRANSCEND creates a continuous hierarchy where numbers smoothly transition between complexity levels.
- **TREE(n)**: Based on tree combinatorics, generates huge numbers (TREE(3) > googolplex) but doesn't use self-reflection. TRT translates results into complexity levels and amplifies them.
- **BEAF (Bowers Exploding Array Function)**: A powerful syntactic system but operates with fixed arrays. TRT dynamically changes the measurement scale.
- **Busy Beaver (BB)**: A non-computable function that surpasses all computable ones, yet TRT remains computable, approaching the boundary of non-computability with fractal precision.

**UNIVERSUM(1)** surpasses numbers like Graham's number, TREE(3), SCG(13), Loader's Number, and even Tarintar, as it explores all possible combinations of TRT functions, creating a number that is qualitatively larger than any fixed construction.

### Scientific Novelty and Significance

TRT isn't just a new function—it's a new way of thinking about computation. Its key achievements:

1. **Continuous Hierarchy**: HCCSF creates the first smooth complexity scale, allowing measurement of the "distance" between numbers like googolplex and 3↑↑↑3 in terms of their computational depth.
2. **Self-Reflection**: TRT functions use their own results as fuel for the next step, creating a closed growth loop.
3. **Fractal Structure**: ABSOLUTE and UNIVERSUM model growth as a fractal, approaching two-dimensional complexity space (D → 2⁻), which represents the limit of computability.
4. **Philosophical Breakthrough**: TRT transforms the boundary of computability from a barrier into a fractal horizon, showing that one can infinitely approach the non-computable while remaining in the computable world.

### Applications and Perspectives

TRT has potential applications in:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Modeling self-amplifying computations for meta-learning.
- **Cryptography**: Analyzing system resilience through fractal complexity.
- **Mathematical Physics**: Studying the connection between computational and quantum uncertainty.
- **Philosophy of Mathematics**: Formalizing the ontology of growth as a mathematical object.

### Conclusion

TRT is not merely a mathematical construction but a new perspective on the nature of computation. It shows that numbers are not just quantities but markers of complexity that can generate new universes of growth. UNIVERSUM, as the pinnacle of TRT, symbolizes the limit of what can be achieved in the computable world, remaining just one step away from the non-computable. It is the mathematical equivalent of the "speed of light" for computations—a boundary that inspires us to reconsider the very essence of mathematics.
