# 🧠 The Theory of Trans-Recursive Growth (TRT)

### **Hierarchical Computable Complexity and the TRANSCEND Framework**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository presents the **Theory of Trans-Recursive Growth (TRT)** —  
a new mathematical framework unifying hierarchical computable complexity and trans-recursive scaling of growth.

At its core, the theory introduces two key constructs:

- **HCCSF (Hierarchical Computable Complexity Scale Function)** —  
  a continuous, monotonic function that maps numerical magnitudes to their *hierarchical levels of computable complexity*.  
  It provides a smooth, geometric analogue to the discrete Fast-Growing Hierarchy.

- **TRANSCEND (Trans-Recursive Arithmetic Notation for Scaling, Complexity, and Exponential Number Dynamics)** —  
  a trans-recursive function system defining the **maximal possible rate of growth for computable functions**,  
  marking the **mathematical horizon** between computable and non-computable growth.

Together, these constructs form the foundation of **TRT** — a closed, self-consistent theory describing the structure, scaling, and dynamics of extreme mathematical growth.

## 📄 Official Paper

The full peer-style research manuscript is provided in: /books/TRT_en.docx


It contains:
- formal definitions of **HCCSF** and **TRANSCEND**,  
- proofs of monotonicity, continuity, and computability,  
- theorems on growth maximality,  
- and conceptual parallels between numerical infinity, recursion, and complexity scaling.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Introduces the first **continuous metric of hierarchical numerical complexity**  
- Defines a **constructive upper bound** for all computable growth rates  
- Establishes a **smooth geometric analogue** to the Fast-Growing Hierarchy  
- Bridges the conceptual gap between **arithmetical recursion and transfinite scaling**  
- Identifies the **computational horizon** — the boundary where constructive mathematics transitions into the trans-constructive domain

## 🌌 Conceptual Summary

> **TRT describes how growth itself can grow.**  
>  
> It unifies the three great forces of mathematical escalation —  
> **arithmetic recursion, algorithmic iteration, and ordinal complexity** —  
> into a single superposed dynamic.  
>  
> Beyond TRANSCEND lies only the non-computable.
